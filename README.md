## Introduction

[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It uses a YAML file to configure the application's services, allowing you to define the services, networks, and volumes required for your application in a single file. This simplifies the process of managing complex applications with multiple interconnected containers.

This repository aims to provide clear, concise, and practical examples of using Docker Compose for various scenarios, including web applications, databases, microservices, and more. Whether you're just getting started with Docker Compose or looking for advanced configurations, you'll find useful examples here to help you along the way.
